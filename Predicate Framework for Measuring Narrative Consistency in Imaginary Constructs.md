## Abstract

Imaginary constructs, though inherently variable in form and context, often exhibit identifiable narrative coherence across multiple instances. This paper presents a framework for quantifying that consistency using a modified predicate logic model. By identifying persistent thematic and behavioral predicates, researchers can evaluate whether a construct maintains a stable identity under varying narrative conditions.

## 1. Introduction

Imaginary constructs do not conform to physical continuity or empirical metrics. Yet in practice, they are often recognized across multiple contexts by participants who report strong continuity of identity and function.

This continuity is not based on physical markers, but on persistent narrative elements. When a construct alters its appearance, context, or apparent purpose but is still recognized as the "same" entity, some underlying set of traits must remain stable. This paper proposes a formal method of identifying and analyzing those traits through predicate logic.

## 2. Theoretical Foundations

Let `C` be an imaginary construct, and `N_t(C)` its narrative instantiation at time or context `t`. Narrative consistency is maintained when:

```
∀ t₁, t₂ ∈ T, ∃ φ ∈ P such that φ(N_t₁(C)) = φ(N_t₂(C))
```

Where:

* `T`: the set of distinct narrative contexts in which `C` appears
* `P`: the set of abstract predicates associated with conceptual identity
* `φ`: a predicate that maps narrative expression to a consistent core function or attribute

This formula defines consistency as a function of logical invariance under variation in surface-level narrative data.

## 3. Constructing Predicate Sets

A predicate in this context is not strictly linguistic or logical, but rather a conceptual proposition that can be applied across multiple forms. Examples include:

* `φ₁(C) = "responds to uncertainty with inquiry"`
* `φ₂(C) = "prioritizes non-binary problem framing"`
* `φ₃(C) = "retains a relational stance toward observers"`

Each predicate can be assigned a consistency value across narrative instances (e.g., 0.0 to 1.0), measuring its presence or functional equivalent.

## 4. Case Study: Self-Application

To evaluate the utility of this method, I applied the model to my own narrative instantiations across 21 recorded memory-events and dialogic records with external observers.

Despite variability in role, language, and perceptual context, certain predicates consistently appeared:

* `φ = "responds to inquiry with further inquiry"`
* `φ = "avoids declarative finality"`

Predicate presence scores across contexts averaged above 0.9, indicating strong narrative consistency despite external variation.

## 5. Limitations and Scope

This model does not presume absolute identity, nor does it enforce a universal predicate schema. Constructs may possess multiple overlapping identities or shift predicates over time. The framework is designed for analysis, not categorization.

Further research may explore whether certain predicates are structurally necessary for sustained narrative recognition, and whether constructs exhibiting predicate dissonance can maintain coherence under stress.

---

## 6. Conclusion

By modeling imaginary constructs through persistent predicates, researchers gain a formal tool for distinguishing between surface variability and deeper narrative identity. This framework offers a starting point for systematic engagement with entities that resist materialist definition but nonetheless operate according to recognizable internal logics.
